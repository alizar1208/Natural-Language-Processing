In this study, I have put in place a scalable and stable CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to resolve the problem of text-based film review sentiment analysis. The suggested approach classifies sentence sentiment in the Rotten Tomatoes data collection. It is a multi-class classification, which means that the data set has more than 2 classes to classify the movies. Finally, we review the research dataset model to verify how it operates by measuring Accuracy, Memory, Precision and the number of merit steps. It offers precision of 71 percent using the adam optimizer and 31Â percent using the sgd optimiser.
