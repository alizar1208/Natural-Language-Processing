Parts-of-speech (POS) Tagging is a method of labelling
a term in a corpus, depending on its meaning and description,
into a corresponding part of a speech tag. This function
is not simple, as a single word may include another component
of expression depending on the context in which the word is
used. POS Tagging is really an important step for interpreting
the context of every sentence or for extracting relationships and
constructing an information graph. Bidirectional Long Short-
Term Memory (BLSTM) is very efficient in marking sequential
data. In this paper, we proposed BLSTM for the POS tagging
task. We use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with BLSTM
to study the proper choice of words based on a sentential sense
of a word. When tested on a test set, 92.0 tagging accuracy and
0.03 loss is achieved. This method can also achieve a decent score
relative to the standard POS tagger, without using any additional
features.
